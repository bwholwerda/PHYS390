There are some statistical tests to help determine both cases: the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and the Anderson-Darling test. \n",

    "**Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S)** test is a nonparametric test of the equality of continuous (or discontinuous, see Section 2.2), one-dimensional probability distributions that can be used to compare a sample with a reference probability distribution (one-sample K–S test), or to compare two samples (two-sample K–S test). *The K-S value is highest (1) when both sample are dissimilar, and lowest (0) when both are from the same parent distribution.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Anderson–Darling (A-D)** test is a statistical test of whether a given sample of data is drawn from a given probability distribution. In its basic form, the test assumes that there are no parameters to be estimated in the distribution being tested, in which case the test and its set of critical values is distribution-free. However, the test is most often used in contexts where a family of distributions is being tested. Null hypothesis is rejected if $A^{{*2}}$ exceeds 0.631, 0.752, 0.873, or 1.035 at 10%, 5%, 2.5%, and 1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two versions of both tests in Python: one where the test is a single sample against a distribution (kstest, anderson) and one where two samples are compared against each other (ks_2samp, anderson_ksamp). Both have their uses."
